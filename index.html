    <p>I am from the beautiful state of Washington, growing up in the city of Bellevue I attended Bellevue Christian High school.</p>
    <p>I developed an strong interest in the field of computer science, when I was interning in an shipyard where I saw how technology</p>
    <p>can transform humans life and prevent humans from doing jobs that are dangerous in an nasty environment, and labor heavy. </p>
    <p>After graduating high school, I can not wait for three more months till I began my journey in Computer Science, well! </p>
    <p>Currently I am sitting in an General Assembly's classroom in New York writing</p>

      <h2>The Snake Game(Kepler-452B Terminator)</h2>
      <p>Technology Used: Javascript, HTML, CSS</p>
      <p>Description: The Kepler-452B Terminator is an engaging web game controlled by the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right). The game starts with a snake of two blocks in a 500x600 square arena. The player directs the snake to eat randomly appearing apples using the arrow keys. Each apple eaten makes the snake one block longer. The game is won when the snake fills the entire arena, and it's lost if the snake's head hits a wall, triggering a reset. The game begins when the user presses any arrow key, starting the apple-spawning process.</p>
